The Decentralized Climate Foundation (DCF) is a non-profit organization based in Mexico City which supports decentralization of environmental and social projects. We believe open governance of projects through decentralization will provide transparency and trust.

## Mission
The Decentralized Climate Foundationâ€™s mission is to provide participation of individuals in climate change actions. The Foundation leads developments such as DECA, that allows individuals to participate in the voluntary carbon market & support the creation of a decentralized person-to-person carbon credit market, which will be converted in the future into a decentralized climate fund.
