## :scroll: How to contribute to DCF.  :scroll:

### :notebook: "Verify that there are no issues in DCF."  :notebook:

"Verify that there are no issues in DCF that address the contribution or problem you wish to collaborate on (as it may have already been started by another user)."

You can check the issues at the following [**link:**](https://github.com/orgs/DECENTRALIZEDCLIMATE/projects/1)


#### "How to create a proposal or an issue:"


If you have previously verified that the proposal or issue does not exist, you can write it following the following format:

After accessing the issues link, we must check if there is no related proposal or issue on the list. If we realize that there is none, we can add one by clicking on the **+** sign and assigning a brief title to it.

**To create an issue in Github, follow these steps:**

1. Access the repository page where you want to create the issue.
2. Click on the "Issues" tab at the top of the page.
3. Click on the green "New issue" button at the top right of the page.
4. Write a brief and descriptive title for the issue in the "Title" field.
5. Describe the problem in detail in the "Write" field.
6. If applicable, use the text formatting options to add formatting, images, or links.
7. Label the issue with appropriate tags to make it easier to find and organize. Tags can be customized by the repository or used from a list of common tags.
8. Assign the issue to a responsible team member or leave it unassigned if not necessary.
9. If applicable, set a due date for the issue.
10. Click the green "Submit new issue" button to publish the issue.

It is important to provide all relevant information so that others can understand the problem and help resolve it. Additionally, it is important to label the issue correctly to make it easier to find and organize. If possible, a proposed solution or suggestions to help solve the problem can also be provided.

### How to contribute after creating my issue

You must clone the [docs](https://github.com/DECENTRALIZEDCLIMATE/docs)  repository to your computer (having the necessary tools and packages to run Jekyll on your computer).


>If you don't have what is necessary to run the repository, you can install what is pertinent for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) by clicking on the link.


When you have the repository perfectly installed and configured, you create, improve or solve your issues and send screenshots in the same issue (as responses to it) where we can see the changes and that it works.
>If you need to access the [Issues](https://github.com/orgs/DECENTRALIZEDCLIMATE/projects/1) section of DCF again, you can click on the link.


Send a Pull Request to the Develop branch of DCF docs, filling in the requirements, such as a brief title and comments on what was done. If everything is approved, your issue will be marked as completed and the changes will be added to the project.

###Suggestions:

- As DCF is a decentralized project, remember that any file, image, or document that you want to contribute needs to have a reasonable size to avoid conflicts when processing it. There are ways to compress it.
